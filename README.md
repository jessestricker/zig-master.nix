# zig-master.nix

A Nix flake providing pre-built master releases of the Zig programming language
and toolchain.

The packaged version of Zig tracks the master version as given in the
[download index](https://ziglang.org/download/index.json) and is updated
automatically by a [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/update.yml).
